Choice of game: Battleship

Pseudocode:

1) Define the required variables used to track the state of the game.

2) Store references for cached elements.

3) When the game loads, initialize the game state and render the game using a render function.

4) Define the required constants.

5) Handle a player clicking a square with a ‘handleClick’ function.

6) Handle the other player’s clicking a square with a ‘handleClick' function.

7) Handle the other player's turn automatically after the player’s move.

8) Create a reset function.

9) Check for win conditions after each move.

Suggested initial data structure:

const gameState =

{

      playerBoard: [], // 2D array representing player’s grid

      enemyBoard: [], // 2D array representing enemy’s grid

      ships: [ // Array of ships with positions and status

            { name: “Battleship”, size: 4, positions: [], hits: 0 },

            { name: “Destroyer”, size: 3, positions: [], hits: 0 }

            ],

            currentTurn: “player”, // Track whose turn it is

            gameOver: false, // Flag to indicate if the game has ended

};
