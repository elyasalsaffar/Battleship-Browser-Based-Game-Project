## ðŸ§  Game Description
Battleship is a classic strategy game where players place their fleet and take turns firing on enemy waters. The goal? Sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours!

This project is a browser-based version built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features an interactive player board and a computer with basic AI logic.

I chose Battleship because it combines logic and randomness, offering a fun challenge in gameplay and in development.
